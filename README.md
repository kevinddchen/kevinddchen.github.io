Here I am using SDK Bundle, but it is very similar to the SDK for Embeds.

<a href="index.html">index.html</a> contains the basic webpage---very simple, nothing much to see here.
<a href="index.js">index.js</a> contains the Javascript.

Github hosts a branch to the domain name <a href="https://kevinddchen.github.io/">kevinddchen.github.io</a>. 
You can create your own branch and develop there, and I can change the site to host that branch instead of `main`.
I also don't mind if you commit directly to the main branch.
If you want to host your own site, you can fork this repo or copy the code over (you just need a production SDK key).
